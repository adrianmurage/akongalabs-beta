# The Power of Honest Communication in Teams

*adrianmurage   June 28, 2025*


## Honesty Without Clarity

Charity joined the team recently. In one of our internal discussions, we stumbled on the concept of **“brutal honesty.”**

Her interpretation of brutal honesty was focused on the word “brutal”. This led to a very very spirited discussion on whether one needs to be brutal to be honest. She questioned whether brutal honesty equated to being rude. She was concerned and rightfully so…


## The Akong’a Way

This to me, was a very teachable moment on the core of our culture here at Akong’a. Charity had done something very very positive by questioning me:

>*Charity chose using questioning to gain clarity as opposed to bowing down to her leader while being disgruntled.*

This is something very very important to me and that’s at the core of the Akong’a DNA. I am human. I am not always right. I will not tolerate a team of “yes” men. I need to trust that my team will question my questionable moves. That my team will keep me accountable. That my team will have my back.

## Back to Charity

We went back and forth with the questions. Taking the opportunity to disagree but elaborate while encouraging more of her questions to troubleshoot on the cause of miscommunication.

Turns out, Charity knows brutal honesty. It just never came packaged with the word “brutal”. At the end of it all, we came to the conclusion that brutal honesty is essential to how we work at Akong’a and everyone needs to embrace it for us to succeed.


## So What Is "Brutal Honesty"?

We think of our company as a high performance sports team. When we’re on the field we need to make critical decisions in split seconds and be able to trust each other’s judgement.

No time to sugar coat.

You say it as it is and your team mate knows the critique is of their work and not of them. Which means that we are all able to pivot quickly and avoid disastrous situations.

While we are in training, it’s a chill environment where we don’t have to be as “brutal”. We spend most of our time in training mode. But when the situation calls for it, we switch quickly, execute. Then get back to rest state.


## The Benefits of Brutal Honesty

> *Many times teams fail due to simple misunderstandings that would otherwise be simplified with a little patience, curiosity and active listening.*

- Adjusting expectations
- Make realistic adjustments
- Highlight critical issues
- Upholding working systems

Good communication breeds by comprehension.

Comprehension breeds understanding.

Understanding opens up space for healthy arguing and dialogue that moves us forward. I believe in curiosity which opens up spaces for dialogues.
