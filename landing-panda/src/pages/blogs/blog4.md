# The Power of Honest Communication in Teams

## Honesty Without Clarity

Charity joined the team recently. In one of our internal discussions, we stumbled on the concept of **“brutal honesty.”**

Her interpretation focused on the word *“brutal”*, which led to a **very spirited discussion** on whether one must be brutal to be honest.

> Does brutal honesty equate to rudeness?
> Is honesty less valid when it’s softened?

She questioned the language—and **rightfully so**.

## The Akong’a Way

To me, this was a **teachable moment** on the core of our culture at Akong’a.

Charity did something powerful:
She used **questioning to gain clarity**, instead of bowing down to her “leader” while internally disagreeing.

That matters—a lot.

I am human. I’m not always right.
And I **refuse to build a team of “yes” men**.

I need a team that:

- Questions my questionable moves
- Holds me accountable
- Has my back by telling me the truth

---

## Back to Charity

We went back and forth, respectfully.

She asked questions. I explained.
She pushed further. I listened.

In the process, we *debugged* the miscommunication.

Turns out—**Charity knows brutal honesty**.
She just never encountered it with the word *“brutal”* attached.

We concluded that **brutal honesty is essential to how we work at Akong’a**—but it must be practiced with care, clarity, and context.

## So What *Is* Brutal Honesty?

We think of Akong’a as a **high-performance sports team**.

When we’re on the field, we must:

- Make **critical decisions** in split seconds
- **Trust each other’s judgment**
- Deliver honest feedback without wasting time

No sugarcoating.
No beating around the bush.

> You say it as it is—because you’re critiquing the *work*, not the *person*.

And that helps us **pivot quickly** and avoid avoidable disasters.

 But we don’t stay in this “brutal” mode forever.

When we’re in *training*, we chill. We question, reflect, learn, and play.
But when it’s game time—we switch, execute, and come back to rest.

## The Benefits of Brutal Honesty

Most teams don’t fail from big breakdowns.
They fail from **small misunderstandings** that were never cleared up.

Brutal honesty helps:

- Adjust expectations
- Make realistic adjustments
- Highlight critical issues
- Uphold working systems

> **Good communication breeds comprehension.**
> **Comprehension breeds understanding.**
> **Understanding creates space for dialogue—and growth.**

That’s what we value at Akong’a:
**Curiosity that leads to clarity, and clarity that builds culture.**
