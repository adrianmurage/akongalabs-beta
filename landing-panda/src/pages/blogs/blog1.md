## Outsized Returns
> *“You’re going to be somewhere in your career in ten years, why not in your absolute ideal role, doing the kind of work you’d find most rewarding and having the kind of impact that you’re capable of? If you don’t believe that this is possible, you will surely fail. If you do believe it’s possible, look honestly — you might still fail! But you’ll at least see better outcomes by believing consistency will work than by believing it won’t.”*

> **Oz Nova, April 2023**

 I’ve worked for some great companies. I’ve worked for some very very shitty companies. In all of them, I gave it my all. But at the end of the day. I owned nothing. The outsized returns of my work were never mine to keep. That changes. For me and for the people who work for me.

## Culture Shift
I am Kenyan. Always was, always will be. There are many things to be proud of as a Kenyan and there are equally as many to be not proud of. Sadly, the Kenyan work culture falls on the “not proud of” side of things.

This changes with Akong'a Labs. The goal is to build a work culture people aspire to be a part of. I take my inspiration from great examples like [37signals](https://37signals.com), [PostHog](https://posthog.com) and many, many more. Too many to have an exhaustive list of.


## The Era of the Startup *Stayup*
We have romanticized startup culture in Nairobi. Startups build hype, raise a bunch of money, build un-validated products for nonexistent markets, wither then die.

That has to change. And it starts with Akonga Labs. We shall be the first of many Kenyan and African businesses to build sustainable companies. Companies that build needed products in existing, validated markets. Companies that prioritize profit over “growth at all cost”.

We’re done with your little games. We’re here to build businesses not wealth transfer machines for “Startup Founders”.

## Learning Over Pedigree
I am still in University. Albeit in my final year and on break indefinitely. And without a degree, I’ve worked for multiple local and international companies for the 6 years I’ve been in this field. I know what interest and grit look like. And that kind of learning needs no stamp of approval from a university or institution of higher learning. Unless you’re in a regulated field. Then by all means go study my dear Lawyers and Doctors. (And anyone else who falls under this category)

For the rest of us. Learning is very very close to free in this day and age. If you’re reading this, you already pass the barrier to entry for learning. Pick a topic of interest, go hard, build something, show it to the world, repeat.

Akonga will be a space for people who value lifelong learning to thrive.

## Remote, No Office Required

Forever remote. Asynchronous first. We save “in person” for fun and gallivanting, the way God intended.
