Onboarding into a new company is always a mixed bag of emotions: excitement, nerves, hope, and curiosity.

For me, joining **Akong'a Labs** was exactly that, but it was also a very *human* experience—filled with genuine support, a clear sense of purpose, and a culture that values learning from day one.

## First Contact

After I got the job, my manager told me I’d be contacted by his assistant, **Ivy**, through their main communication channel—**Telegram**.

Ivy reached out as promised. From the first message, she came across as a warm and friendly soul. She introduced herself, congratulated me, and assured me that she’d be supporting me through every step of the onboarding process.

She walked me through the setup of all my work accounts and explained the systems I’d be using. It was clear from the start that onboarding here wasn’t just a formality—it was **thoughtfully planned and genuinely welcoming**.

## Tools, Platforms & First Introductions

At around 10 AM, I had an online meeting with my manager. We reviewed the tools the team uses:

- **Linear** – Project management and tracking deliverables
- **Basecamp** – Company documents and internal discussions
- **GitHub** – Codebase and contribution management

Even though Ivy had already helped me set up my Linear account, my manager helped me link it to my work email. That attention to detail ensured that everything was aligned for the road ahead.

Before diving into the code, my manager asked if I had watched the system overview video—already shared on Telegram. The video explained what we’re building, why it matters, and how the architecture is set up.

*(Of course, I had already watched the video. I’m a good sport.)*

It made all the difference—it gave meaningful context to what could have otherwise just looked like lines of code.

## When the Real Learning Begins

Then came the dive into the codebase, and a light note to the newbies:

> **If you haven’t been paying attention until now, this is where you need to lock in. Hard.**
>
> You will get lost if you don’t ask questions. Ask what that new term means. Don’t let “buzzwords” float by. Because guess what?
> They’ll come up again and again—and eventually, they’ll be tied to an actual task.
>
> If you don’t understand something now, it only gets harder later.
> So stay curious, take notes, and most importantly, ask.

This advice isn’t just for others. It was a reminder to myself too—to stay engaged and to permit myself to be a learner.

## Expectations and Encouragement

I asked my manager what his expectations of me were.
His answer was simple but profound:

- Stay curious
- Learn as much as possible
- Ask for help, but also learn *how* to ask for help
- Take breaks
- Work sustainably

He didn’t ask me to prove myself; he asked me to **grow**.

He also shared resources to help me get started and encouraged me to explore, question, and even document my learnings.

That, in itself, felt like a **culture of trust**.

I wasn’t expected to know everything; I was expected to be open to learning anything.

## The Akong'a Way

What stood out the most in my onboarding wasn’t a tool or a document—it was the **culture**.

Akong'a Labs is supportive, curious, and most importantly—**open**.

From the clarity of communication to the emphasis on personal growth, this isn’t just a startup—it’s a place where **people are built, not just products**.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

Onboarding isn’t just a welcome ceremony—it’s your **first impression** of how a company values people, knowledge, and purpose.

At Akong'a Labs, that first impression has been **meaningful**, **motivating**, and **empowering**.

I’m excited for what lies ahead, and even more excited to share that journey.
