# Solve, Build, Get Paid: Open Source Bounties at Akong’a

You don’t have to be on payroll to earn money.

Akong’a Labs wants you to earn by solving real problems. How? Open source bounties. To be clear, this isn’t the vague “open-source contributions look good on your CV” stuff. Bounties, requirements, and payouts. Open to those willing to build. That’s it. That’s the blog post.

## What’s a Bounty Anyway?

A bounty, in this context, is a technical challenge. A problem that needs solving, a feature that needs building or a bug that needs squashing. With a reward attached to those who provide valid solutions for either case.

Solve it right, solve it first, get paid. In that order.

You don’t need to be an insider to participate. If you’ve got the skills, the curiosity, and the discipline to follow instructions and build quality code, you’re welcome. In fact, these bounties can’t be solved by members of the Akong’a team.

## What to Expect

Glad you asked.

- **Tech stack is fixed (mostly)**:
  React (with Vite), TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL

- **Testing matters**:
  If you don’t test your code and its functionality—you’re out.

- **Clean code or go home**:
  Self-documenting, readable, maintainable.
  If someone has to ask, *“What does this do?”* — it’s not making the cut.

- **Working demo or it didn’t happen**:
  Either deploy it, or record a video showing that everything works.

If at this point you’re thinking to yourself, “those rules seem quite strict”. You’re right on the money. They are. A high bar to entry allows us to ensure the submissions are of the quality we expect. We are able to look at them knowing they meet our standards. Low support needs for us, quick vetting process for you. A win, win.

## A Quick Reality Check
The bounties are demanding. They’re meant to be. They’re not for people looking for shortcuts. They’re for developers who want a serious challenge. People who are learning and want real experience. Programmers who want to test their skills in public. Everyone who’s curious, bold, and willing to grow.

## Where’s the Money?
As for payments, you’ll get paid in USDT / USDC through Binance. [It’s all laid out in the repo.](https://github.com/AkongaLabs/OSS-bounties/blob/main/docs/PAYMENT.md)

## “Wait… I Can Use AI?”
Yup. Use AI tools if they help you Cursor, Zed, ChatGPT, whatever works for you. But (and this is a **big but**) if you can’t explain your own code?! That’s an automatic disqualification.

It’s okay to use AI, just don’t be a passenger in your own life (submission).

## Why This Is Bigger Than Just Code
At its core, this bounty program is about building a culture of contribution. Showing developers in Kenya and larger Africa, you don’t have to wait to be hired to start building. You can earn, grow, and prove your skills right now.

Akong’a Labs is trying to flip the script on what a startup can be. And these bounties are part of that. It’s not just “open source” for show it’s open source with real rewards, real standards, and real opportunity.

Sustainable open source for a change. It’s about time.

## A Quick Note From Me
As someone who has and still is experiencing the culture at Akong’a Labs first-hand, I can tell you the bounties reflect everything we stand for.

They stand for transparency, learning, and ownership.

I love that this isn’t just about code. It’s about encouraging people to:

- Push themselves
- Ask questions
- Get hands-on with real-world architecture
- Actually ship things that work

The reward is the growth, the discipline, the confidence that comes from solving a challenge that looked scary at first. And the money is not a bad extra.

If you’ve been looking for something to test your skills, add real projects to your portfolio, or just prove something to yourself this is it.

## Ready to Try One?

Check out the bounties here [Akong’a Labs OSS Bounties GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AkongaLabs/OSS-bounties/issues)

Pick a challenge, read the instructions, follow them to the letter, ask questions in public if you’re stuck, and most importantly: build something that works.

Good luck, and happy coding! ✨

## One Last Thing…
Our founder is working with the founder of Gumroad on a similar bounty program. Check it out over at: [Antiwork/bounties](https://antiwork.com/bounties):

- $100,000 worth of bounties
- When the above bounties end, sahil floats $1,000,000 worth of bounties.

Don’t walk, run!
