# Solve, Build, Get Paid: Open Source Bounties at Akong’a

You don’t have to be on payroll to earn money.

**Akong’a Labs wants you to earn by solving real problems.**

How? **Open source bounties**.

To be clear—this isn’t the vague *“open-source contributions look good on your CV”* stuff.
These are bounties, with requirements, and real payouts. Open to anyone willing to build.

> That’s it. That’s the blog post.



## What’s a Bounty Anyway?

A **bounty**, in this context, is a **technical challenge**.

A problem that needs solving, a feature that needs building, or a bug that needs squashing.
With a reward attached to whoever provides a **valid**, working solution.

> **Solve it right. Solve it first. Get paid.**
> In that order.

And no—you don’t need to be an insider to participate.
In fact, **Akong’a team members are not allowed to participate**.

If you’ve got the skills, the curiosity, and the discipline to follow instructions and build quality code—you’re welcome here.



## What to Expect

Glad you asked.

- **Tech stack is fixed (mostly)**:
  React (with Vite), TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL

- **Testing matters**:
  If you don’t test your code and its functionality—you’re out.

- **Clean code or go home**:
  Self-documenting, readable, maintainable.
  If someone has to ask, *“What does this do?”* — it’s not making the cut.

- **Working demo or it didn’t happen**:
  Either deploy it, or record a video showing that everything works.

> Yes, the rules are strict—**on purpose**.

A high bar to entry ensures that submissions meet our quality standards.
That means less back-and-forth, easier vetting, and more trust in your work.

> A win-win for everyone.



## A Quick Reality Check

The bounties are **demanding**. They’re meant to be.

They’re not for people looking for shortcuts.
They’re for:

- Developers who want a serious challenge
- People learning and looking for real experience
- Programmers who want to test their skills in public
- Anyone curious, bold, and willing to grow



## Where’s the Money?

Yes—you get paid.

Payments are made in **USDT or USDC**, through **Binance**.
All details are laid out clearly in the GitHub repo.



## “Wait… I Can Use AI?”

Absolutely. Use Cursor, Zed, ChatGPT—whatever works for you.

But (and this is a big BUT):
**If you can’t explain your own code? That’s an automatic disqualification.**

> Use AI wisely—just don’t be a passenger in your own submission.



## Why This Is Bigger Than Just Code

At its core, this bounty program is about **building a culture of contribution**.

It shows developers in Kenya—and across Africa—that you don’t have to wait to be hired to start building.
You can **earn, grow, and prove your skills right now**.

Akong’a Labs is flipping the script on what a startup can be.

This isn’t *“open source” for show*.
It’s open source with **real rewards, real standards, and real opportunity**.

> Sustainable open source.
> It’s about time.



## A Quick Note From Me

As someone who has (and still is) experiencing the culture at Akong’a Labs first-hand, I can tell you:

> These bounties reflect everything we stand for:
> **Transparency. Learning. Ownership.**

I love that this isn’t just about code. It’s about encouraging people to:

- Push themselves
- Ask questions
- Get hands-on with real-world architecture
- Actually ship things that work

The **real reward** is the growth, the discipline, the confidence that comes from solving a challenge that looked scary at first.

And the money? That’s not a bad bonus either.
